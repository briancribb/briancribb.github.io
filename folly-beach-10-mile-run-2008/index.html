<p>This is a relatively new event, enjoying its second year and organized by Mike and Pat Logins from The Extra Mile.</p>

<p>The course was pretty similar to the Folly Beach Save the Light Half-Marathon, but that’s understandable since Folly Beach is only so big. I’m in training for a marathon, so I didn’t plan on breaking my neck out there. I just wanted to cruise a bit and enjoy a good run with some familiar faces.</p>

<h3 id="registration-and-recognition">Registration and Recognition.</h3>

<p>Mike and Pat were working diligently to get things started. Pat was working the registration desk and Mike was… hell, I don’t know. He was doing some sort of race stuff, I would imagine.</p>

<p>This is the first race I’ve participated in since growing my beard. Along with the hat, this apparently changes my appearance to a severe degree. All over town, people have had trouble recognizing me, and this race was no different. After a couple of comments about the beard/hat combo, I got registered and settled into the pre-race routine. Everyone was in good spirits, but we were a little worried about the wind and the possibility of rain.</p>

<h3 id="supercops-on-amazing-crime-stopping-vehicles">Supercops on Amazing Crime-Stopping Vehicles</h3>

<p>I can understand bicycles. That makes perfect sense in a city. I can also understand the very small motorcycle that I’ve seen a police officer ride in Charleston. These vehicles are well-suited for easy navigation in the downtown area.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter"><img data-flickr-id="6246395347" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6115/6246395347_4273873c07_c.jpg" alt="Supercop Ruckus" /></figure>

<p>There’s more, though. I’ve seen two different types of Segways downtown, and now I’ve seen a moped. It has blue lights and everything. There’s a whole article here just waiting for me to write it, full of wit and opinion regarding unusual vehicles and physical standards.</p>

<p>It won’t be written today, however. I don’t want to pick on some guy who was helping us out. I spotted two of these police mopeds patrolling the course to make sure that things were going well. Thanks, guys. We literally couldn’t do these races without you.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

<p>I wasn’t sure if I wanted to carry the camera with me this time. I had tossed it into the car, but found myself missing it more and more. I ran the short distance to the car and back as a warm-up, and finally made the decision to retrieve my Nikon.</p>

<p>It’s too bad, really. I would have like to have gotten a few shots of Mike lecturing the crowd about the quirks of the course and why they should tear off the tag from their race numbers when they finish. Before I move to Burlington, I’m going to try to get a photo of him with that bullhorn, addressing the crowd like a teacher just before a field trip.</p>

<p>As with the other small races, Mike led us on a bicycle. As he took off, I wondered how hard it would be to stay ahead of some of the faster runners. But really, everything was pretty standard at this one. I ran steadily throughout the course and spurred myself into a sprint after gaining a visual on the clock. Then I ate a bunch of fruit and cookies at the end.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>This was a fun event, even though I’ve seen Folly Beach before. I performed well over the ten-mile course, and I think I’m ready for the marathon next month. The two jobs have prevented me from training the way I would have liked to, but I can get to the Finish Line in one piece. The trick will be in the pacing.</p>
