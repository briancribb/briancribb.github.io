	<p>It’s time for another Run for Empowerment! I did this one back in 2009 when I lived in Burlington the first time. It’s a fun romp along the bike path, and it benefits <a href="http://www.whbw.org">Women Helping Battered Women</a>. And for the first time ever, I got to run as the Living Embodiment of Evil. Good times!</p>

<p>Cara had to work, so I ran this one solo. good thing, too. Instead of a regular entry fee, they had a “donation” requirement. The minimum was $35. Not too bad for a single, but for two people it’s a bit steep for a race without a t-shirt… or rather, no t-shirt for donations less than $100.</p>

<p>But hey, I don’t mean to complain. It’s a smaller race, and they’re doing their best to grow. They didn’t have shirts when I first ran this event in 2009 either. The important thing is the money they raised for their charity.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-the-brian">Number of the Brian</h3>

<p>Something Different happened when I registered for this one. Something that I don’t think I would have seed Down South. I registered right after runner 665, so my number was… wait for it…. 666! Seriously, I was <strong>666</strong>.</p>

<figure class="alignleft">
  <img data-flickr-id="7382789960" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7096/7382789960_db21d8c78e_c.jpg" alt="Brian with Race Number 666." />
  <figcaption>I&#8217;m really not so bad. Honest.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If this race were in Charleston, or any southern state, there’s a good chance that this number would have been thrown out. It’s the Number of the Beast, after all. But of course, that’s a matter or perspective. When I laughed at the number, one of the race volunteers told me that the number was actually good luck in pagan circles. She was trying to reassure me, I suppose. I didn’t doubt her, of course. The Romans incorporated quite a bit of pagan culture when they were stomping around and annexing people. But in this case, please don’t tell me that this is good luck. You’ll kill a good line of jokes for me.</p>

<p class="clearfix">But I digress. All jokes aside, it was a Hell of a race. (See what I did there? I said I wasn&#8217;t joking, and then I stole a joke from a friend of mine. Very clever of me.) Just like last time, it wound through Waterfront Park before entering the bike path. There were three events in all: The Kid&#8217;s 1K race, and then the joint 5K/10K events. I say &#8220;joint&#8221; because we were all together until we hit a literal fork in the road. 5K people went left, and the rest of us went right.</p>

<h3 id="racing-and-raffling-for-not-so-evil-empowerment">Racing and Raffling for Not-so-evil Empowerment</h3>

<p>I was surprised at how well I did. I mean, <a href="/run-for-empowerment-2009/">last time I did this race,</a> my situation was about the same as this time. 5K drills at the most, hadn’t run a 10K in a while, etc. Of course, I had  a better fitness level to begin with at the time. This time I <em>really was</em> out of shape. I had real trouble <a href="/all-kinds-of-weather/" title="All Kinds of Weather">training through a New England Winter</a>. I did okay, though. 51:02 isn’t a Personal Record, but it’s not bad. <em>(My chip time is a bit longer because I forgot to turn off my Garmin.)</em></p>

<p>Most likely, my lack of proper training was mitigated by my obvious demonic abilities. Because that’s what the Number of the Beast does for you. It lets you run at a moderately decent pace. Kind of a let-down, really.</p>

</figure>

<p>Anyhoo, stuff was good after the race. I got some good Finish Line pics, and I even waited for the award ceremony. There was a snag, though. They goofed up the winners, giving medals to a couple of people before the runners noticed that the first place people weren’t actually first.</p>

<p>Medals were given back, and the volunteers went back to their computers to figure things out. I wound up waiting for the entire raffle just to see if I got anything, but my number must be unlucky or something. At least I got to chat with some of the other runners, including a fun dude named Paul.</p>

  <figcaption>Here&#8217;s a picture of him. He&#8217;s on the left. He won a prize at the raffle. (Smiling, polite bastard…)﻿</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, in conclusion, things went pretty well. It was a fun race with great weather and a bunch of fun people. I really enjoyed this one.</p>
