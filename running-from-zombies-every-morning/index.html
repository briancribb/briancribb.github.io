	<p>Lately I‚Äôve been running from zombies every morning to gather supplies for a small settlement of post-apocalyptic survivors. I know, it sounds like more crazy talk. No surprises there, but I‚Äôm serious about the zombies. They‚Äôre virtually wheezing down my neck me every morning. And of course, like any reasonable person, I‚Äôve been running away. <em>[EDIT: I bought this during a promotion, so the price is actually more like $8 instead of $4.]</em></p>

<p>Before you start thinking that I‚Äôve actually managed to misplace my few remaining marbles, I should tell you that I‚Äôm talking about an iPhone game. For the price of a beer, I bought an interactive radio show with game components and interval training blending in somehow. Get this‚Ä¶ you can only play it while you‚Äôre running. And there are zombies.¬†It‚Äôs called <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com/">Zombies, Run!</a></p>

<p>You can get the story from their website, but I‚Äôll sum it up by saying that it‚Äôs¬†part radio show, part town-builder. As you run, you automatically collect supplies. Those supplies can be used to upgrade the town, which unlocks missions, etc. The missions themselves are well-written and extremely engaging. I find myself looking forward to the next mission, the next show. I‚Äôve already fallen completely in love with the cast of characters.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs engaging in a number of ways, but the neat thing is that you can‚Äôt play this from the couch. You actually have to get up and move around. And of course, for a zombie game to be complete there needs to be some element of risk. I mean, what use is a running zombie game if you don‚Äôt actually run from some zombies?</p>

<h3 id="running-from-the-actual-zombies">Running from the Actual Zombies</h3>

<p>Well, have no fear. There‚Äôs a special feature called ‚ÄúZombie Chases‚Äù that you can enable in the app‚Äôs settings. Occasionally you‚Äôll be informed that zombies have been detected, and you‚Äôll need to pick up your pace to evade them. Seriously, you have to run faster for up to a minute.¬†If you don‚Äôt make the pace, then you‚Äôll drop an item to distract them.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">

	<figcaption>As you run from imaginary zombies, don&#8217;t forget the real-life cars.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have no idea why a bottle of water or a packet of underwear would distract a zombie, but it seems to be rather effective. It also comes with a warning. Even though it‚Äôs really exciting to hear zombies moaning at you as they try to catch up and steal your tinned food or batteries, you should remember to pay close attention to the real-life cars out there. For this reason, I strongly suggest long stretches of road with few intersections, or a trail somewhere. The Burlington Bike Path is ideal. ¬†üôÇ</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been insanely entertained for the past couple of weeks, which is good because the psychological effects of the game are a bit creepy sometimes. The sun is rising earlier now, but when I‚Äôm out there before sunrise it‚Äôs pretty easy to imagine that other runners or walkers are making a play for my brains. Or that old shirt I found earlier. Or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, it‚Äôs a sweet game. I recommend it. If you haven‚Äôt played it yet, I encourage you to give it a try. If you‚Äôve already played it, please feel free to leave some no-spoiler comments!</p>
