<p>Since Cara is in Vermont, I had decided to drive down to Charleston and spend Thanksgiving with my brother. It was going to be a triple-threat: beer, movies and pizza. And just for a bit of nostalgia, I was going to do the <a href="http://www.turkeydayrun.com/">Turkey Day Run</a> again. But at the last minute, I did a little financial math and decided against it. I just took my car in for some repairs, and Iâ€™m losing two days of work because of the holidayâ€¦ it just didnâ€™t seem like a good time to use up all that gas and pay a race fee.</p>

<p>So instead, I decided to run on my own for free. Itâ€™s not as nice as a 5K in Charleston, and Iâ€™m even a little bummed that I didnâ€™t go for the one here in Columbia. But really, when am I going to find another opportunity to safely run down Broad River Road? The traffic was actually kind of sane today, and a little awareness was all I needed to be safe.</p>

<p>Even the weather was cooperating. There was a bit of a chill in the wind, but after the first mile I was completely comfortable. I went all the way to the bridge over the Broad River and took a left into the little dirt road that leads to Riverfront Park. Thereâ€™s a place to park cars and the gate doesnâ€™t close until 9pm, so I made a note to come back soon after work. The canal ends at a little bridge before joining with the river, and when you cross it you get this view:</p>

	<figcaption>The light was just perfect for this one. ðŸ™‚</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At first I had been thinking of a 10K run. Then I thought maybe I would do 8 miles. Once I was outside I figured I would just go 5 miles out and turn around for a 10-mile. But when I was at the dam, looking around at the beautiful water and the other people who were showing up to enjoy the parkâ€¦ well, I just had to run into the park for a mile or so before turning around. I wound up with a 12-mile Thanksgiving Day run!</p>

<p>There was just one problem. At around 10 miles, my wet, sweaty shirt had finally washed away my BodyGlide. This is mainly a problem in warmer months and for longer distances. As long as I have a dry shirt or donâ€™t run too long with a wet one, Iâ€™m fine. But this was 12 miles in nice weather. Eventually both nipples were bleeding, and I had to wash the shirt by hand to keep it from staining. I think it might be time to start using those small round Band-Aids for these longer distances. Hopefully theyâ€™ll prevent the problem in the future.</p>

	<figcaption>It isn&#8217;t as bad as it looks. Stings a bit in the shower, but they&#8217;re just a little sore after that. No worries.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the end, I think I did pretty well. 12 miles this morning, and a guilt-free Thanksgiving this afternoon. Iâ€™d rather be with my brother eating pizza and watching World War II documentaries, but he understood why I stayed here. Besides, my sister and the parents are happy to have me around. Speaking of which, Iâ€™d better post this and get over there. Iâ€™m really hungry. Not cranky-hungry, but getting there. Iâ€™d better drive over so I can stuff my face.</p>
