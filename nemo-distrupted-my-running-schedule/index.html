	<p>I had a pretty good plan, but it got messed up by a Historic Winter Storm. It wasn’t just snow… this thing had a <strong>name</strong>. They called it Nemo, and I found it on the home page of weather.com without entering my zip code. If I was going to run in that, I figured I should do it early.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img alt="It Has a Name: Nemo" src="/generated/assets/img/posts/2013/it-has-a-name-800-665b98d29.jpg" srcset="/generated/assets/img/posts/2013/it-has-a-name-400-665b98d29.jpg 400w, /generated/assets/img/posts/2013/it-has-a-name-800-665b98d29.jpg 800w, /generated/assets/img/posts/2013/it-has-a-name-1000-665b98d29.jpg 1000w" />

<p>Seriously, this is what I saw on Thursday. This thing was going to blast several states with tons of the white stuff, and it was going to dominate the weekend. Of course, it was a bit of a blessing that it was hitting us on Friday instead of Tuesday. I worked from home for one day and then I had the weekend to deal with whatever Mama Nature decided to hit us with. I posted a bunch of pics on Flickr that you can check out below, but for now I’ll focus on the running part.</p>

<p>Friday wasn’t bad. The snow started Thursday night, so there was some coverage in the morning and some shoveling to do. The snow was light and fluffy, so I made quick work of our steps and sidewalk and cleared the car. After that, I went out for a little trip around town.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter">
	<img alt="Cover That Snowy Lens" src="/generated/assets/img/posts/2013/cover-that-snowy-lens-640-2d31208fb.jpg" srcset="/generated/assets/img/posts/2013/cover-that-snowy-lens-400-2d31208fb.jpg 400w, /generated/assets/img/posts/2013/cover-that-snowy-lens-640-2d31208fb.jpg 640w" />

	<figcaption>Yes, that&#8217;s ice on my face. I had ice all over me after all that wind and snow.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Everything was already covered, and I was really glad to have my <a href="/new-years-and-shoe-spikes/" title="New Years and Shoe Spikes">Death Spikes</a> and <a href="/old-navy-is-good-to-runners/" title="Old Navy is Good to Runners">Space Jacket</a>. As you can see in the photo, I also wore ear covers and a balaclava to keep my neck comfy. It worked pretty well for most of the run. I did a 6K loop through downtown Portland and came home to remote into work.</p>

<p>It was a good thing I kept it short, though. By the end of it my fingers weren’t working properly. That was quickly solved by a hot shower and a cup of coffee, but it’s a clear sign that I was out there too long with sub-standard gloves. I hate to call them that, actually. They have some holes in the finters, but that’s how I use my iPhone when I’m out there.</p>

<p>Although Friday worked out, I didn’t bother on Saturday. The wind was crazy and the snow  was even crazier. Once the wind settled down, I spent most of Saturday afternoon clearing our sidewalk and punching a hole for the car. I was going to widen it the next morning, but the guys at the halfway house next-door did that for me sometime in the evening. <em>(Nice guys.)</em></p>

<p>And of course, the City of Portland filled everything in overnight. I know it sounds paranoid, but I think these guys get their kicks from filling in driveways. Mine was completely refilled this morning, all the way to the sidewalk. It was just a bit too thorough to be a simple case of snow being pushed from up the block. It certainly wasn’t mine, because I always toss it downstream on our one-way street.</p>

<p>So anyway, I spent this morning punching that hole again and making it car-worthy. I even went out there this afternoon to clear some melting slush that had fallen from the roof when today’s sunshine was taking effect.</p>

<p>So although I didn’t run at all this weekend, I don’t think I missed out on any training. I got several serious workouts. And I expect I’ll miss tomorrow’s run as well, since my driveway will most likely be blocked again. Nice job, Portland.</p>
